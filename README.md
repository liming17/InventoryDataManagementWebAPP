# Introduction

This project is to help my uncle manage the inventory data of his leather boutique store, and help me practice what I have learned at school/during my Co-op. 

The features include product save/update/delete/search.

Primary data analysis features include monthly/seasonal sales data viewing.

Store employees have to sign in to edit the data.

Greatly appreciate my uncle to provide the chance to work on this real-based project
